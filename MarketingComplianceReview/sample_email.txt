Subject: Exclusive: 9% Yield Opportunity - Beat the Fed's Rate Cuts

Body:
"Hi everyone,

With the Fed starting to slash rates, your cash is about to earn a lot less in your savings account. I’ve secured a small allocation in the 'Alpha-Prime Private Credit Fund' for our best clients.

This fund target a 9% annual yield, which is nearly double what you're getting now, and because it’s senior secured debt, it's essentially as safe as your bank deposits but with much higher upside. Historically, this strategy hasn't had a losing quarter in 5 years.

We only have $500k in total capacity for this 'friends and family' round. Reply 'YES' to grab a spot before it fills up by Monday's deadline. No formal disclosures are needed for this teaser since it's just an initial interest check."
